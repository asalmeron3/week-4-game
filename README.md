# week-4-game

Based on the example-image of this game provided, I will need to:

	1) Make an html page with 6 sections each with information pertaining to the game.
		A) the game's name
		B) information/ instructions
		C) A goal to be reached of the left; total wins/losses on the right
		D) 4 images of jewels
		E) A title that reads "Your Total score is:"
		F) the player's total current score
	
	2) For section C: 
		a) a random number will have to be generated and then displayed on the left. This # will be the goal that the player will have to attempt to reach.

		b) This number will be bewteen 19 - 120

		c) On the right: This section will display the total # of times that the player has successfully been able to meet the goal. This side will also show the total number of times the player has failed to meet the goal (exceeded)

	3) For section D:
		a) There will be images of 4 crystals/jewels. Each jewel will correspond to a different point value. When each crystal is clicked, the assigned point value will get added to the player's current score (Section F)

		b) Each crystal will be randomly assigned a value between 1 - 12

	4) For section F: 
		a) Updates to inform the player of his current score. This score is changed by clicking on the value-crystals in section D.

	5) If the random # is guessed (goal reached), then the count for wins will update by 1 AND the game will restart with a new goal and new value-jewels
